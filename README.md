# Python Banking System (Console Project)🚀

A **simple, menu-driven Banking System** built using Python. The project allows users to perform core banking operations like creating accounts, deposits, withdrawals, fund transfers, interest calculation, and more — all using a terminal interface and `.txt` files for data storage.

## 📖 About the Project

This project mimics a basic banking system using Python. It demonstrates how file handling can simulate real-time banking logic without a database. All data is stored in two text files — `accounts.txt` and `transactions.txt`.

## 📘 What I Learned

This project helped me strengthen my Python skills and apply programming logic to real-world scenarios. Here's what I gained from building this:

- 🧠 Implemented core banking operations using logic and conditionals  
- 📁 Learned file handling using `.txt` files for persistent storage  
- 💡 Improved problem-solving through menu-driven CLI design  
- 🔐 Practiced user authentication and data validation techniques  
- 🔄 Managed data flow for deposits, withdrawals, and transfers  
- 📊 Structured and modularized code for better readability and maintainability  
- 🛠️ Built a complete project without using a database — simulating backend logic with text files  

> This was not just a Python project — it was a journey through logic, creativity, and hands-on learning!
